Progressive Web App (PWA) Calculator

This is an small weekend day project to create an PWA Calculator for my iPad,
and try it out with ES6. Not perfect, but maybe helps anyone else too.

I know it's a little bit *overloaded* for an "calculator". 
I've tried different ways, as you can see on *calc.bak.js* and the other scripts.

Feel free to extend, modify, or just feedback.

## Future

Maybe this will come in future. But currently it's fine ;-)

* Webpack usage
* add package.json
* any ideas or hints?

## Last changes

* Removed jQuery. No works without it.
* Removed bootstrap.min.css and made a simple grid using CSS Flex.
